This article helps you understand the concept of Machine Laerning. The details of algorithms are not introduced here. The basic comes in FAQ format.

**What's the ML (Machine Learning)?**

ML: the computer algorithm with data feed to achieve self-evolving solution. A video of the introduction to Machine Learning? ([2 minutes video](https://youtu.be/QghjaS0WQQU))

>Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience.

**What's the difference from AI (Artificial Intelligence)?**

AI: general concept to allow machines to act like humans. In this sense, AI is the intergated product of "smart" machine, which can include the algorithm, the soft/hard-ware and the interaction with human or environment.

**What's the difference from Statistics / Data Mining?**

The common part is data driven. Statistics / Data Mining study the patterns, relationships or anomalies of data / large data set. This requires human intervention and decision making. Machine Learning fully/partially cuts the human intervention.

**The classification of Machine Learning**

* Supervised Learning - labelled
* Unsupervised Learning - non-labelled
* Reinforcement Learning - interaction/dynamics to maximize the cumulative reward (e.g.Go game, the next step depends on the interaction of the opponent, and there is no sure win until the last stage but the highest chance to win.) A fun example is the [Mario video](https://youtu.be/qv6UVOQ0F44)

> *Deep Learning, also known as deep neural learning or deep neural network.* 
>> *It's not one of the classification of problems that Machine Learning is going to solve. Instead, Deep Learning is an algorithm of neural network to solve any problem it can.*

**The common algorithms**

* Regression
* Decision Tree
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting (GBT)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Neural Network

ANNs - Artificial Neural Networks
